      <description>I had completed the analytics engineering bootcamp in Udemy. So data modelling and dbt are not new to me. In week 4, some interesting take-aways for me are the usage of dbt cloud and the software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. Great course as usual from dezoomcamp!</description>

      <description>In week 2 we learned Prefect to manage our data flow. I like Prefect very much because it allows to use python to define tasks and flows. Very interesting topic to learn!</description>
